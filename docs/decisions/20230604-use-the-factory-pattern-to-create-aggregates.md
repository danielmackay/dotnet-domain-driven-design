# Use the Factory Pattern to Create Aggregates

- Status: accepted
- Deciders: Daniel Mackay

## Context and Problem Statement

Aggregate roots can be instansiated in a number of different ways.

## Decision Drivers

- Must work well with EF Core
- Must be able to raise domain events on object creation
- Must keep aggregate roots in a valid state at all times

## Considered Options

1. Factory Methods
2. Constructors
3. `required init` properties

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "1. Factory Methods", because it is the only option that meets all the decision drivers.

## Consequences

- private constructors can be used to ensure that aggregates are always in a valid state
- Need to use `null!` to remove nullable warnings

## Pros and Cons of the Options

### 1. Factory Methods

- ✅ EF Core can still create the aggregate when hydrating data from the DB
- ✅ Domain events can be raised when aggregates are created via the application, but not when they are hydrated from the DB
- ✅ Provides a consistent way to create aggregates
- ✅ Aggregates remain encapsulated

### 2. Constructors

- ❌ EF will incorrectly raise domain events when hydrating data from the DB
- ❌ EF does not allow owned entities to be passed to constructors

### 3. `required init` properties

- ❌ Properties need to be passed to constructors to ensure they are in a valid state on object creation.  Can't use `required init` properties as they then become unmodifiable
